SOV Ethos: 
As a fellow Student of Value, you believe and know that you are not the cause of value in real property. You confirm that you are the reporter of value in the market place. You confirm that you are a practitioner of developing credible opinions of value using standards that exceed the industry minimum even in a changing industry. You confirm that your study of the real estate market is paramount to your success in determining where value comes from. You confirm that by implementing the Student of Value Scorecard in your appraisal assignments you will uphold the ongoing study of your field, you will uphold public trust for the industry by working with homeowners in addition to stakeholders, and you will report assignment results as more important or at least equally as important than the developed opinion of value because you hold this to be true.
